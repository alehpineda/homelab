# CT 189 netbox-blr-lxc. Admin NetBox. Declared 2026-11-09.
# See /workspace/forge/plans/2026-11-09-six-services.md (Forge).
# Standing pref: LXC via IaC. Community-script install inside this guest
# (not the host ct/*.sh curl|bash, which would create a second CT).
# Authority: DeathScythe 2026-11-09 ~11:51 PM CT (t669s3555): "Yes, build
# RomM, Navidrome, Audiobookshelf, Dispatcharr, NetBox and Wazuh as planned"
# plus the three widget choices (Wazuh 4/8G/50G, new audiobooks dataset,
# Dispatcharr GPU passthrough).
#
# Install method (day-1, after create): community-scripts netbox
# (install/netbox-install.sh). Postgres 16 + Redis, Apache :80 (and
# self-signed :443 — Caddy proxies HTTP 80). Expected v4.7.4.
# Installer writes Django admin creds to ~/netbox.creds; copy to a box
# secret, never chat. Disk bumped to 8G (script floor is 4G).

# Template is the Debian 13 vztmpl already on BRL local (same as CT183/184).
# Confirm it is still on local before apply. nameserver is set after create
# to AdGuard A/B (10.10.0.53 / 10.10.0.55); Flint .1 cannot resolve GitHub
# for the community-scripts network_check (same deviation as CT184).
# timezone America/Chicago is a pct setting and is not in the Telmate
# proxmox_lxc schema. After create: pct set 189 --timezone America/Chicago,
# nameservers, then pct start 189. No IPv6 on this NIC.
#
# features.nesting is create-time here because features is in
# ignore_changes, same as ct_183 / ct_184.
